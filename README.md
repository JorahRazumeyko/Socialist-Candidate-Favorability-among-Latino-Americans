# Favorability of Socialist Candidates Among Latino Voters Who Trace Their Ancestry to Communist Countries

---

## Abstract:
This project seeks to determine if a socialist candidate is less popular among Latino Americans who trace their ancestry back to communist countries. We find that such Americans are less favorable of candidates running as “socialist” by looking at the favorability of Bernie Sanders among Latino Americans with different backgrounds.

## Introduction:

Some have argued that it is best to avoid running a candidate who accepts the label of “socialist as it may drive down turnout among Latino Americans who disapprove of socialism. This argument assumes that those who trace their ancestry back to Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, which have had a history of socialist government policies, will be less likely to support a socialist candidate.

## Data:

We can test this by looking at the [2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey data](https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR38040.v2) (CMPS), which asked Latino American respondents “To what country do you or your family trace your ancestry?”, resulting in over 3000 responses. Using this we can group together respondents that chose Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as our “communist-roots” group and all other Latino American respondents as our “non-communist-roots” group.

We can pair this with question asking if a respondent has a “favorable view or unfavorable view of Bernie Sanders”, who ran as a Democratic Socialist during the Democratic Presidential primary.
